                <h2 id="business-challenge">Business challenge</h2><p>Everysk is the leading provider of risk workflows for multi-asset, global
portfolios with portfolios that span many different asset classes. A key part of
any financial risk assessment is understanding the time varying value added
factors and exposure of the investment, as well as having an index against which
to compare performance.</p>
<p>In liquid markets indices can be readily calculated from public and relatively
frequent transactions, allowing for comparison, risk assessment, and
benchmarking of portfolios. Private Equity lacks similar transaction-based
performance measures; estimating them is not a straightforward process, and
requires some statistical estimation.  So how can we figure out the unknown from
the things we know? The answer lies with Bayesian Statistics.</p>
<p>Modern day Bayesian statistics is a combination of statistical expertise,
business knowledge, and computing. By combining the strengths and using a
principled approach, organizations are able to gain deeper insights than
previously possible. The multifaceted nature of this challenge was a perfect
match for a partnership between PyMC Labs and Everysk, as Everysk had the data
and business expertise, and PyMC Labs lent the statistics and computational
expertise.</p>
<h2 id="from-understanding-to-implementation-to-extension">From understanding to implementation to extension</h2><p>PyMC Labs and Everysk set up an initial client meeting to jointly scope out the
problem from a technical and business perspective. Everysk and PyMC Labs
reviewed existing code together, briefly talked through <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2356553ß">the
paper</a> Everysk
wanted to implement, as well as what Everysk was looking to do with the model.
From these conversations, the joint team was able to align on key latent (i.e
hidden), factors of interest, and the “checkpoints” to ensure the analysis was
on the right track.</p>
<p>With understanding of the task and solution, PyMC Labs spent the first week
exploring the data, understanding the details of the paper, and building an
initial model. This initial model served as a testing ground, to ensure that
modeling the hidden factors of interest was possible, that the results were
sane, and that there was value for Everysk. Because the PyMC Labs developers are
also the maintainers of PyMC, they were able to incorporate numerous
improvements to the original paper that led to a faster and more accurate model.
For example the original paper used first generation samplers, which were quite
slow, while PyMC Labs upgraded the samplers to speed up the run time of the
model, leading to faster iteration cycles.</p>
<p>In particular, this approach was needed by Everysk, as it wasn’t seeking
predictions but rather seeking understanding of why the trend line was behaving
a certain way. This insight would not have been available from a standard
machine learning analysis.</p>
<p>With Everysk, PyMC Labs worked hand-in-hand to interpret the results, fix any
outstanding issues, and run experiments. By having the team available for
questions, Everysk was able to become more comfortable with the results.</p>
