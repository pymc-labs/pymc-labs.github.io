testimonial: PyMC Labs implemented a complex Bayesian private-equity model for us that provided value by estimating characteristics of financial assets. Communication was seamless and they provided invaluable support when presenting this model to our own client. They are truly experts in Bayesian modeling and probabilistic programming and are a pleasure to work with.
